## 3. Source Code License

The ApiFlow **source code** is licensed under the MIT License (see LICENSE file).

You may:
- ✅ View and study the code
- ✅ Modify the code for personal use
- ✅ Fork the repository
- ✅ Contribute improvements (subject to acceptance)

However, **generating documentation with ApiFlow** is subject to these Terms of Service, regardless of the MIT License on the source code.

**Key Distinction:**
- **Source code** = MIT License (open source)
- **Product usage** = Tiered licensing (these terms)

This dual-licensing model allows developers to learn from the code while ensuring commercial use is properly licensed.

---

## 4. License Validation

PRO and BUSINESS tiers require a valid license key to unlock premium features.

License keys:
- Are validated offline (no phone-home, privacy-focused)
- Are cached locally in `.apiflow/` directory
- Must not be shared publicly or redistributed
- Are tied to the purchasing entity (person or company)

### 4.2 License Transfers

- PRO licenses are **non-transferable** (one person or company only)
- BUSINESS licenses **may allow transfers** (contact us for approval)
- Selling or sharing license keys violates these terms

We reserve the right to revoke licenses if:
