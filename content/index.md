# Hi, I’m Ilia — and I built this

This website is generated by a static site generator I wrote in Python. It turns Markdown into clean HTML using a tiny template and a simple, testable pipeline. No frameworks—just code I understand end to end.

## What’s here

- [About](/about.html): why I built it, what I learned
- [Docs](/docs.html): how to use and customize it

## Why this project

I like small tools that feel human and fast. Building my own generator forced me to design a clear model, write tests, and keep the UX simple: write Markdown, get a site, deploy to GitHub Pages.
