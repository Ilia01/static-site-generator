# Future Ideas

This project is deliberately small, but there’s a lot I can add without losing the handmade feel.

## Content and structure

- Generate a blog index and per-tag listing pages
- Support drafts and scheduled posts
- Add a 404 page and basic client-side search

## Build system

- Incremental builds and a watch mode
- Cache busting for assets (hashed filenames)
- Validate internal links during build

## Output and SEO

- Generate RSS/Atom and `sitemap.xml`
- Friendly metadata: description, OpenGraph, and canonical URLs
- Accessibility: skip links, focus styles, and landmark roles

## Markdown features

- Fenced code blocks with syntax highlighting
- Tables and footnotes
- Smart typography (quotes, dashes)

If you’re interested in any of these, reach out—I’d love feedback.
